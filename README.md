# Landscape_Image_Classification
classifying landscape images with neural network

This image data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6
categories.
All images are divided into 6 classes:
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

You are asked to train a model with following steps:
1. Download data and get familiarized with it.
2. Normalize and preprocess data.
3. Visualize a batch of training data.
4. Specify Loss Function and Optimizer.
5. Train the Model.
6. Load the model with the lowest validation loss.
7. Test the trained network.
